# Cats and dogs classification using CNNs 

Welcome! This is my first deep learning project and it is going to be a simple kernel on image recognition. Feel free to comment and make any changes, I am open to any feedback :) 

## Problem statement: 
I will be implementing Convolution Neural Network (CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images. I used the Asirra dataset, which can be found here. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
The model will be trained on the training set, which consists 25000 rows and 2 columns. 
I will be using Python on VSC.
